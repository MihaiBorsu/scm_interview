# 100 Switches

There are 100 Switches in a row that are all initially closed.

You make 100 passes by the switches.

The first time through, toggle every switch (if the switch is closed, open it; if it is open, close it).

The second time, only toggle every 2nd switch (switch #2, #4, #6, ...).

The third time, toggle every 3rd switch (switch #3, #6, #9, ...)

Repeat until at the 100th pass, you you only toggle the 100th switch .

## Task

Answer the question: what state are the switches in after the last pass? Which are open, which are closed?

You may write a script in C++ , Python or Bash.
