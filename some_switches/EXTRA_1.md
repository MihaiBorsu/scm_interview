# 100 Switches

## Parameters input

The number of initial switches and the number of passes to be made, need to be given to the script.For example "script_name 50 42" would have 50 switches and 42 passes.

History of the states of the switches should be printed to the console, not just the final result.

Tip: Make the history print as one line per pass and the switch state being represented by 2 characters (like X and O or _ and | ).
