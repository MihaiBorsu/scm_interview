# Attractive numbers

A number is an   attractive number   if the number of its prime factors (whether distinct or not) is also prime.

### Example

The number   20,   whose prime decomposition is   2 × 2 × 5,   is an   attractive number   because the number of its prime factors   (3)   is also prime.

## Task
Show sequence items up to   120.

# FizzBuzz

## Task
Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive).

## But:
    for multiples of three,   print   Fizz     (instead of the number)
    for multiples of five,   print   Buzz     (instead of the number)
    for multiples of both three and five,   print   FizzBuzz     (instead of the number)

# Guess the number

## Task
Write a program where the program chooses a number between   1   and   10.

A player is then prompted to enter a guess.   If the player guesses wrong,   then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct.

When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a   "Well guessed!"   message,   and the program exits.

A   conditional loop   may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.
